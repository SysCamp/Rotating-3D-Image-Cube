These examples demonstrate more advanced and visually engaging techniques to create impressive 3D effects with images.


Explanation:

 1. Scene and Perspective: The .scene class adds perspective to create a 3D effect.

 2. Cube Container: The .cube class contains all six faces of the cube. The transform-style: preserve-3d; property allows for 3D transformations.

 3. Cube Faces: Each face of the cube (.front, .back, .left, .right, .top, .bottom) is an image with specific transformations to position it correctly in 3D space.

 4. Mouse Move Effect: JavaScript is used to add an event listener to the .scene container. The cube rotates based on the mouse movement, creating an interactive 3D effect.

 5. Form: The form contains six file input elements, each corresponding to a side of the cube (front, back, left, right, top, bottom).

 6. JavaScript:
   - File Reader: When a file is selected, it is read using a FileReader. The resulting image is set as the src of the corresponding side of the cube.
   - Cube Rotation: The cube rotates based on mouse movement, creating an interactive 3D effect.
